AWS Capability Test - Recommendations
======================================

Based on the test results, here are key findings:

1. EC2 CAPABILITIES:
   - If EC2 RunInstances is ALLOWED: You can launch EC2 instances
   - If EC2 DescribeInstances is ALLOWED: You can monitor existing instances
   - If both are DENIED: You have no EC2 access

2. S3 CAPABILITIES:
   - If S3 CreateBucket is ALLOWED: You can create new S3 buckets
   - If S3 ListBuckets is ALLOWED: You can see existing buckets
   - If S3 GetObject/PutObject are tested separately, they show data access

3. SERVERLESS CAPABILITIES:
   - Lambda CreateFunction: Shows if you can deploy serverless functions
   - API Gateway access: Shows if you can create APIs

4. DATABASE CAPABILITIES:
   - RDS CreateDBInstance: Shows if you can create databases
   - DynamoDB CreateTable: Shows if you can create NoSQL tables

5. CONTAINER CAPABILITIES:
   - ECS/EKS/ECR permissions show container deployment abilities

WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH ALLOWED PERMISSIONS:
- Any operation marked as "âœ“ ALLOWED" can be executed
- Dry-run successes indicate the actual operation would work
- Focus on services where you have both read and write permissions

NEXT STEPS:
1. For allowed operations, remove --dry-run flags to execute
2. For critical denied operations, request specific IAM permissions
3. Use allowed read operations to audit existing resources
